title: What this blog is about
---

I've been procrastinating for years to start blogging and this stops now (lol).

I considered using one of the blogging platforms out there but I just don't want to worry about engagement, followers, discoverability, tags, etc. My goal is to have a place to talk about whatever is on my mind and minimize the time from "offline" to "online".

This blog is not a source of income nor a way for me to promote myself. I want a place to "think out loud", in public. This blog is simply a piece of me, but online. That said, expect insights, opinions and lots of good/bad takes on my favorite topics: math, the universe, programming, philosophy, work and life - one could say that these topics are all the same topic but I'll hold that thought for another day.

Welcome to my blog!
