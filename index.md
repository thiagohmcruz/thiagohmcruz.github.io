![My avatar](/assets/me.jpg#avatar-home "That's me")

I'm a programmer with 10+ years of experience developing for Apple platforms.

Over the years I got involved in projects not related to mobile development as well. I enjoy looking for elegant solutions to complex problems so every now and then I get myself playing around with different tools and/or programming languages.

I'm a good listener and I believe that empathy is one of the most valuable assets any team could have.

Born in Brazil and living in Toronto. If I'm not coding I'm spending time with my cat, having (more) coffee, reading, binge watching or playing games.

This was the very first program that I wrote. Bad UX, questionable architecture, scalability is ok-ish:

{% highlight C %}
// foo.c

#include<stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf("Hello World!");
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

To see what I did next check out my [projects](/projects) page or my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.

Feel free to [contact](/contact) me anytime.
