![My avatar](/assets/me.jpg#avatar-home "That's me")

üëãüèº My name is Thiago and I'm a programmer with 10+ years of experience developing for Apple platforms.

Currently, I'm working for <a href="https://block.xyz" target="_blank">Block</a> on the iOS Developer Experience (iOS-DX) team.

I also help maintain <a href="https://github.com/bazel-ios/rules_ios" target="_blank">rules_ios</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bazel-ios/cocoapods-bazel" target="_blank">cocoapods-bazel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/rules_xcodeproj" target="_blank">rules_xcodeproj</a>.

Small list of facts about me:

* I'm a great listener
* I believe empathy is fundamental for any kind of human relationship (personal or professional) to succeed
* I was born and raised in S√£o Paulo, Brazil
* I'm currently living in Waterloo, Canada, and I spent the 5 years prior living in Toronto
* When I'm not coding you'll find me reading, eating, binge watching or playing games
