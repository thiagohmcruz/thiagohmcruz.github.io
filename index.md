![My avatar](/assets/me.jpg#avatar-home "That's me")

I'm a programmer with 10+ years of experience developing for Apple platforms.

I'm currently working for [Block](https://block.xyz) on the iOS Developer Experience team. I help maintain [rules_ios](https://github.com/bazel-ios/rules_ios), [cocoapods-bazel](https://github.com/bazel-ios/cocoapods-bazel) and [rules_xcodeproj](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/rules_xcodeproj).

Small list of facts about me:

* I'm a great listener
* I believe empathy is the most valuable asset any team could have
* I was born and raised in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Moved to Canada and lived in Toronto for about 5 years before moving to Waterloo where I'm currently located
* When I'm not coding I'm reading, eating, binge watching or playing games.
